# MLOps

This repository is created for learning and understanding the core concepts of MLOps in a structured and practical way.

The main objective of this project is to help bridge the gap between building machine learning models and managing them effectively in real-world systems. It focuses on learning how ML workflows are organized, automated, and maintained over time.

The repository follows a step-by-step approach, where each section introduces a new concept in the MLOps lifecycle. Topics are added gradually to make the learning process clear and easy to follow.

Key learning areas include data handling and preprocessing, experiment tracking, model training and evaluation, basic model versioning, and simple deployment workflows.

Alongside model development, this repository introduces fundamental MLOps practices such as pipeline structuring, environment management, and automation basics.

The focus is on understanding *why* each step exists in the ML lifecycle and *how* different components connect, rather than only achieving high performance or production scale.

This repository is intended for students and beginners who want a solid foundation in MLOps before moving on to advanced or large-scale systems.
